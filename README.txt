Qahiri is a Kufic typeface based on the modernized and regularized old
manuscript Kufic calligraphy style of the late master of Arabic calligraphy
Mohammad Abdul Qadir.

Following the convention of naming Kufic styles after the cities they appeared
in, Qahiri (قاهري) is named after the city of Cairo, Egypt (القاهرة).
